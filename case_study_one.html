          <p>
            The existing app had a bad user experience with no design
            guidelines, and UI elements, which made it difficult to the user to
            find or buy the products through app, even the app is serviceable in
            multiple states of India, multiple language option was not available
            for the user.

          <h4>What can be Done ?</h4>
          <p>
            Design a mobile app that facilitates farmers to purchase
            agricultural products easily. It aims to simplify the process of
            viewing products, checking prices, and making purchases online
            across 7+ states with multiple languages. The app will feature a
            user-friendly interface, intuitive navigation, and vibrant UI color
            schemes to enhance the user experience.

          <b>Geographic Insights:</b>
          Explored the geographical distribution of our user base to pinpoint

        <p>
          <b>Demographic Profiling:</b>
          Collected detailed user personas by collecting data on gender, age

          In this phase, we categorize the collected data from the user
          research, created user personas and their journey. To understand the
          user pain points and their requirements, we determined and identified
          :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our customers</li>
          <li>Their problems</li>
          <li>The solution to their problem</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><b>User Personas</b></h4>
        <p>
          Based on our insights and user engagement from the research methods,
          we created two personas that captured the essence of our users and
          their characteristics. We also formed empathy maps to understand their
          needs and challenges.

          points and the opportunities for improvement.

          <p><b>The problem</b></p>
          <p>
            The personas, empathy, and Journey map help us understand the
            problems and I have listed some of the problems from the outcome
            which are outlined below
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Complexity in Purchasing: </b>Farmers often find it challenging
            to buy agricultural products online due to complicated interfaces
            and language barriers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Inefficient User Experience: </b>The existing app offers a dull
            user experience with a cluttered layout, making it difficult for
            farmers to find and purchase the products they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Language Barriers: </b>Many farmers may not be proficient in
            English or other commonly used languages, leading to confusion and
            frustration when navigating the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Poor UI Color Schemes: </b>The current UI color schemes may not
            be visually appealing or may not convey the app's purpose
            effectively.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4><b>The Goal</b></h4>
          <p>
            <b>Streamlined User Experience: </b>The primary goal is to provide
            farmers with a seamless and intuitive user experience. They should
            be able to navigate the app effortlessly, from product search to
            purchase confirmation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Multilingual Support: </b>The app should support multiple
            languages, allowing farmers to use it comfortably in their preferred
            language. This includes both product information and interface
            elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>One-Click Purchase:</b>The app should enable farmers to make
            purchases with minimal effort. Ideally, they should be able to add
            products to their cart and complete the transaction with just one
            click.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Appealing UI Color Schemes: </b>Improving the UI color schemes to
            align with the agricultural theme and evoke a sense of trust and
            ease for farmers is essential. Consider using earthy tones, greens,
            and other colors associated with farming to create a visually
            pleasing environment.
